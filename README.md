## Assignment 1
The reason why I want to take this class is partly because it is one of the required classes to take before officially entering my major. More deeply speaking, I took this class because it will be one of my very important stepping stones in acquiring knowledge, and having a basic understanding and background in programming. I know that being a programmer can be very difficult for newbies and for those new to the field. I was one of them myself, and I realized that getting the background right The basics are one of the things that I have to prioritize. And so this class will be one of those classes that I'll put a lot of heart into, I'll keep trying no matter how much I fail.
