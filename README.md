# CIS106 VI MAI

## Assignment 1

The reason why I want to take this class is partly because it is one of the required classes to take before officially entering my major. More deeply speaking, I took this class because it will be one of my very important stepping stones in acquiring knowledge, and having a basic understanding and background in programming. I know that being a programmer can be very difficult for newbies and for those new to the field. I was one of them myself, and I realized that getting the background right The basics are one of the things that I have to prioritize. And so this class will be one of those classes that I'll put a lot of heart into, I'll keep trying no matter how much I fail.

## Assignment 2

The language that I choose will be the Python programming language, because of its variety and versatility in its programming applications. Python for me is a programming language with strong advantages such as easy to read, easy to remember and easy to learn. Compared to other languages, Python has less syntactic structure. Python's structure allows the user to write code with the least number of keystrokes. In addition, Python has powerful high-level data structures and a simple yet effective approach to object-oriented programming. For me, Python is an easy language for beginners, and it would be a great starting point for me.

I am still confused about choosing an IDE for my programming language, so far there are 2 IDEs that I feel most comfortable with, Pycharm and Thonny. Both include the basic functions needed by the IDE such as error detection, syntax error highlighting, automatic code completion support, etc. But personally, I think I would still choose Thonny because of its simplicity and accessibility to newbies like me. Also maybe in the future when I'm comfortable with the Python programming language I'll start thinking about switching to a more advanced and versatile IDE. But for now I will and continue to use the Thonney IED as a tool for learning to code in our class.

## Assignment 3

After completing the required work, I realized that making and testing the code was harder than I thought. The following is missing or is in the wrong order or the code is not working properly is something I encountered while I was working on it. I have a bit of a hard time at times, but I still manage to get things done, and it's safe to say that the feeling after seeing my code run safely and smoothly on Thonny makes me happy. Sometimes there was a bit of a problem with the order and the results I didn't want, but from there I learned how to make things more efficient. I realized that making and testing a piece of code is not difficult, the real difficulty is whether I myself will take the time to learn from mistakes or not. Learning to code made me pay more attention to the details of the work, adding details like each brick was put in making it even more solid.

## Assignment 4

I think for me limiting my use of Flowchart slightly reduces my programming capabilities, because it really helps a lot in my programming work. But I was able to get used to it, the problem I have now is the structure of my code is quite long, so I will find a way to shorten it. Having a long piece of code is not a bad thing for me, because it gives me a chance to better implement its mechanism. But I will try to do it in the shortest and most efficient way possible, because it can speed up my process more to catch up or lead the class. So I will focus on learning how to make short but effective code, and Python is the best language for that. Also I need to pay attention to the small details, because even when I use Flowchart some outputs still don't work as well as I want it to, and it ends up spending more time on it. . As for me practicing code structure I am confident I can do it, but correct calculations are my top priority. For me the lesson this time around is to always find a way to make things better, and try to check the small details in case such cases happen again.

## Assignment 5

  In this Assignment this time there is nothing too special to learn and give my own opinion, mostly because it is similar to the assignments in Section 2. What I think a lot at the moment is the difference when using Flow with IDE, I notice the difference when I use code on different side. For me Flow will be basic and nothing outstanding, all you need to do is put words or commands into empty boxes with different shapes. It follows an established pattern, and creativity is sometimes quite limited. I think the case where I use Flow will apply when I'm really having a hard time building the code so that it follows the path. But the IDE is something very different, when it just gives you a higher difficulty, because you won't have the built-in constructs for you. Instead you will be the creator of the code and its structure, and that will increase your independence and creativity. I reviewed 2 pieces of code made by Flow and IDE made by me, and I noticed a big difference in the way I create a code structure. In the IDE everything seems to be more concise and efficient, although not as secure as Flow, but it shortens the time it takes me to create a more structured code.
